HELVARNET PROTOCOL
Connection
To establish a TCP connection and therefore communicate with the router, the third-party
device is required to connect to listener port number 50000. When using the UDP protocol, the
third-party device is required to send a message to destination port number 50001 in the
router.
Routing entries of the following type allow generic data transmission over Ethernet:
 ETHERNET TRANSMIT triggered by a group / block / scene recall: This causes
transmission of a generic string, from a single router .
When the entry is triggered, a connection to the third party device is instigated from the router.
The IP address and port to which the connection to the third-party device is made is determined
from the routing entry’s configuration:
 To send TCP messages from the router to the third-party device, the router connects to a
listener port provided in the third-party device. It is recommended that this listener port is
in the range of 49152 to 65535.
 To send UDP messages from the router to the third-party device, it is recommended that
the destination port in the third-party device is in the range of 49152 to 65535.
 Additionally, the IP address of the router that is responsible for the transmission of the
generic string also needs to be configured.

System Access and Message Routing
Messages from the third-party device can be targeted at any router in the system.
If access has not been granted or has been blocked to a particular router, then communications can still
be achieved to that router via any other router in the system, provided that you have the IP address of
another router and the third-party device is allowed access to it.
If a query message needs to be sent to a router for which access has not been granted, then the query
message can be sent to any of the alternative routers, following this the response to the query – the
query reply message – will be returned by the router to which the query was originally sent.
Message Format
Any message sent to, or received from, a router can be in either ASCII or raw binary form (see
Command Format for more information). Messages must not exceed the maximum length of
1500 bytes. The format of the data contained within messages is defined by the protocol. A
query reply message from the router will be in the same format as the query command message
sent i.e. if a query message is sent in ASCII form then the reply will also be in ASCII. Throughout 
this document, ASCII format examples will be used. Push Messages are internally generated
messages from routers to external HelvarNet clients. Device Types in Helvar: Routers (905

Panels), Converters, DALI Controller, Dimmers, HID, Input Units, IR Receiver Panel (170), LED Drivers,

Network Topology
A topology is a description of the arrangement of the various elements (nodes, connecting lines,
etc.) of a communication network.
There are two types of network topology that can be applied to a router :
 single cluster
 multicluster
The following sections describe what these topologies are and which one you should use.

Single cluster and multicluster
A cluster is a collection of routers that work together or have some common locational element.
For example, in a large building with several floors, all routers on a single floor could belong to
the same cluster; routers on another floor could belong to another cluster; and so on.
Note: A cluster could also map to a logical network strategy. For example, on a layer 3 network, if routers
are assigned on different IP subnets, clusters can be mapped directly on to those subnets. Clients are no
longer part of the clustering system. They can be located anywhere on the network.
We recommend that a single cluster should contain no more than 30 routers.
Which topology type to use
First, the type of topology depends on how many routers the system has:
 Use single cluster for systems with no more than 30 routers.
 Use multicluster for systems with 30 routers or more.
Second, the type of topology depends on whether communications between the routers is
confined to a logical IP subnet or spans multiple IP subnets.
 If the IP network is a layer 2 network, the router system can constitute a single cluster or multiple clusters.
 If the IP network is a layer 3 network and the router communications are confined to a logical IP subnet, the router system can be made up of a single cluster or multiple clusters.
 If the IP network is a layer 3 network and the router communications are required to traverse across logical IP subnets, the routers system will contain multiple clusters.

Same IP subnet
Members of a cluster must reside on the same IP subnet as the other members of the same
cluster.
Defining a cluster and its members
The cluster is determined by allocating a portion of the IP to be the cluster’s identifier. This
portion, which must lead from the left, is determined by the accompanying setting called ‘cluster
mask’.
This mask is very similar to the subnet mask and follows the same IP masking rules. The cluster
member is determined by the part of the IP address that is masked out by the cluster mask.
Examples:
 A router with an IP address of 192.168.1.1 with a cluster mask of 255.255.255.0 has a
cluster identifier of 192.168.1.0 and a cluster member identifier of 0.0.0.1.
 A router with an IP address of 172.28.228.10 with a cluster mask of 255.255.255.0 has a
cluster identifier of 172.28.228.0 and a cluster member identifier of 0.0.0.1.
 A router with an IP address of 172.28.228.10 with a cluster mask of 255.255.0.0 has a
cluster identifier of 172.28.0.0 and a cluster member identifier of 0.0.228.10.
 A router with an IP address of 10.254.0.1 with a cluster mask of 255.255.255.0 has a
cluster identifier of 10.254.0.0 and a cluster member identifier of 0.0.0.1.
 A router with an IP address of 10.254.0.1 with a cluster mask of 255.255.0.0 has a cluster
identifier of 10.254.0.0 and a cluster member identifier of 0.0.0.1.
 A router with an IP address of 10.254.0.1 with a cluster mask of 255.0.0.0 has a cluster
identifier of 10.0.0.0 and a cluster member identifier of 0.254.0.1.
Note: The default cluster mask of 255.255.255.0 will suffice for most network addressing strategies

GENERAL CONTEXT INFORMATION FROM VARIOUS PARTS
Workgroups
Within the context of a lighting system , a Workgroup is a collection of routers that work together
and communicate with each other. Every lighting system must contain at least one Workgroup.
A lighting system is normally just a single Workgroup. However, on some sites there may be more
than one Workgroup. For example, each building on a campus could be a separate Workgroup.
Addresses
An address is a number or sequence of numbers used to identify a router , subnet , device or
subdevice in a lighting system . Each item has a unique address that is either defined automatically
(by Designer or the router), or defined manually (by the user with Designer or at the physical
device).
Address Structure for Items
Each address is made up of up to five numbers in the format:
Cluster ID.Cluster Member ID.Subnet.Device.Subdevice
Router Address Format 
Routers have an address in the format of Cluster ID.Cluster Member ID
Subnet Address Format
Subnets have an address in the format of Cluster ID.Cluster Member ID.Subnet
Device Address Format
Devices have an address in the format of Cluster ID.Cluster Member ID.Subnet.Device
Subdevice Address Format
Subdevices have an address in the format of Cluster ID.Cluster Member
ID.Subnet.Device.Subdevice
DALI Subnet
A DALI subnet is a collection of DALI devices, all connected on one cable, which are connected
to a router . Each router can support two DALI subnets.
The DALI protocol is used to communicate between DALI devices on a DALI subnet. DALI
device addresses are automatically set by the router system.
Up to 64 devices can be connected to each DALI subnet

SDIM Subnet
An SDIM subnet allows the Imagine 920 Router to drive control gear such as the Imagine range
of dimmers, relay units and ballast controllers, or Digidim loads with SDIM capability. The
router has one SDIM subnet which can support up to 128 SDIM devices, within the limits of 252
SDIM addresses. SDIM is an internal Helvar protocol used to communicate between SDIM
devices (control gear) on an SDIM subnet. Unlike DALI devices, whose addresses are
automatically set by the router system, SDIM addresses are set at the device by a DIL switch or
menu selection. There can be one or more addresses, depending on how many channels the
device has.
DMX Subnet
Note: Only the Imagine 920 Router has a DMX subnet connector and can therefore support one
DMX subnet
DMX (Dimmer MultipleX) is a communications protocol developed by USITT (United States
Institute for Theatre Technology), commonly used to control stage lighting and effects.
The standard is intended for lighting system and entertainment system designers who want to
integrate systems of lighting equipment and accessories, including dimmers, with controllers
made by different manufacturers.
DMX Subnet Communication
DMX512 is designed to carry repetitive control data from a single controller to one or more
receivers. This protocol is intended to be used to control dimmers, other lighting devices and
related non-hazardous effects equipment.
Note: A DMX Lighting Control Console (or Lighting Desk) controls the levels of channels in
the range from 0 to 255. When the DMX subnet is in DMX 'Out' operation, if you send a
command to set a DMX channel to 100 % then the channel goes to 255 on the DMX device
(all other levels are scaled proportionally). When in DMX 'In' operation, and you send a
command to set a DMX channel to 100 %, the controlled SDIM channel goes to 100 %.
DMX 'In'
If the subnet is in this operation, then the SDIM and/or DALI devices are controlled channels
(inputs) on their controlled SDIM and/or DALI subnets. These subnets can support up to 512
channels in from one DMX source.
DMX 'Out'
If the subnet is in this operation, then the DMX devices on the subnet operate as loads (control
gear ). This subnet can drive up to 512 DMX output channels.

Scenes
In its simplest sense, a scene is a set of levels. A scene can be assigned to a control panel button
so that, when the button is pressed, the levels defined in the scene are set
Discovery
Before you configure the router ’s network settings or lighting settings, the following is necessary:
 The client computer running Designer needs to be able to discover the routers.
 The routers need to discover one another.
This is achieved by the discovery mechanism, which involves the transmission of a discovery message.
Discovery message
The discovery message is transmitted via a UDP broadcast or UDP multicast. The ability to receive the
message depends on the type of network on which the routers and client reside.
 If the network is a layer 2 network, the client and all routers will receive the UDP broadcast
message.
 If the network is a layer 3 managed network, the UDP broadcast may not be sufficient for the
client or all routers to receive the message. The reason is that UDP broadcasts are not always
permitted to travel through managed switches due to concerns regarding network packet
flooding. Therefore, the routers allow for the discovery message to be transmitted via a UDP
multicast. The type of protocol used for transmitting the discovery message can be selected
using the two properties ‘Broadcast Discovery Message’ and ‘Multicast Discovery Message’.
These allow each type to be enabled or disable.
Note: When testing whether the multicast discovery message works, it can be helpful to use both UDP
broadcast and UDP broadcast messages. If you have to use multicast discovery messages, enable them
leaving the broadcast method enabled until you are satisfied that it is working properly. One of both
methods needs to be enabled at any one time, because the router will not allow both the broadcast and
multicast methods to be disabled.
Broadcast Discovery Address
In certain cases, it may be appropriate to change the broadcast address. This is an advanced topic and
should only be carried out by someone with a good understanding of IP networks and IP subnetting. It is
recommended to leave the default setting of 255.255.255.255 as it is.
Multicast Discovery Address
If you decide to adopt the multicast discovery mechanism, your network administrator will advise on the
correct settings to use. The address must be in the range from 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255.

Network Administration
If the network is a layer 3 managed network, it will be administered by an IT professional. Therefore, it is
important to work closely with the administrator to determine:
 the course of action to take regarding the discovery mechanism; and
 what the IP addressing strategy will be.
In any case, the discovery message must be permitted to travel through the managed network
unhindered
Names and Conventions
Router, Subnet and Device Names
Every router , subnet , device and subdevice has a default name (the item name), followed by the
item’s unique address.
It can be useful to rename important items to indicate their location or function in the system.
This helps you to organise the workgroup design. For example, if a router controls the lighting
for a restaurant, renaming it to Restaurant makes its function more obvious.
Names can be up to 43 characters long, and may contain any characters.
Scene Names
By default, each scene in a lighting system has a unique name, composed of the group to which
it belongs and the scene block and scene number to which it relates. Scene names can be edited to
make them easier for you to identify and remember their purpose in the lighting system. Names
can be up to 43 characters long, and may contain any characters. See Rename a Scene.
Naming Conventions
A variety of naming conventions are used in the lighting design. These vary from simple
numbering of devices to using codes that identify a component, its location, power, and so on. If
you are working with a lighting design that has been provided to you, it makes sense to use the
chosen convention.
If you have the opportunity to choose a naming convention, we suggest you use an acronym or
abbreviation for each item in the lighting system. For example, use the letter ‘D’ to indicate a
Downlight, ‘P’ to indicate a Panel, and so on. By using such a code with a sequential numbered
suffix for each item, you can identify items in a way that makes it easy to cross-reference your
workgroup design with the various floor plans and specifications for the project.

Command Table
Commands can be sent in either ASCII (text) or raw format. In ASCII format, the commands are
split into parameters and in raw format the commands are split into binary Words which contain
the parameters.
Each command contains:
• a command number.
• parameters that address devices or lighting operations.
• parameters that are required to accompany the commands.
ASCII Format
The ASCII format requires that certain rules concerning special characters, parameter identifiers, and
delimiters be adhered to. These rules are as follows:
1. The ASCII string must begin with the command character '>' and end with the Terminator character ‘#’.
2. Replies to queries begin with the character ‘?’ and the data concerning a query’s response is separated
from the query string using the character ‘=’. Similarly, the whole query response string is terminated
with the character ‘#’ that signals the end of the reply, or '$' that signals the end of a partial response.
For example, a response that contains more data than the maximum message size would be split into 2
responses. The first partial response would be terminated by '$', and the second partial response would
be terminated by '#'.
3. Error / Diagnostic messages begin with the character '!' and, again, end in ‘#'.
4. Unless they are optional, all of the parameters required for the command must be included; otherwise
the message is rejected and discarded.
5. The ASCII parameters are not required to be ordered.
6. The parameter identifiers are to be included as shown in the following table, i.e. all alphabetic
identifiers should be in upper case.

For example, in the command Recall Group 1234, Block 5, Scene 6, Fade Time 32 s, the string is
sent as follows, including the delimiters and the start character ‘>’ and stop character ‘#’:
>V:1,C:11,G:1234,B:5,S:6,F:3200#

>V:1,C:14,L:60,F:9000,@1.2.3.4#
Proportion Control Commands
When sending a ‘Direct Proportion’ value, this value relates to a proportion of the difference
between the last recalled scene level or direct level and the output limits of the device.
When sending a positive value, this is a proportion of the difference of said level and 100 %
level. For example, if the last recalled scene level or direct level is 44 % and you send a ‘Direct
Proportion at 50%’ command, then the level rises from 44 % to 72 % (100 – 44 = 56;
56 × 50 % = 28; 28 + 44 = 72).
When sending a negative proportion value, this is a proportion of the difference of the last
recalled scene or direct level and 0 %, which so happens to be a proportion of the level itself. For
example, if the level is at 44 % and you send a command to perform the ‘Direct Proportion’
function at –50 %, then the level decreases to 22 % (i.e. 50 % of 44 %).
Notes:
 The range for the ‘Direct Proportion’ and ‘Modify Proportion’ functions is –100 % to
100%.
 Any succeeding ‘Direct Proportion’ commands will also use the last recalled scene or
direct level as a base mark.
When sending a ‘Modify Proportion’ value, the same formula applies, only you are changing the
currently applied ‘Direct Proportion’ value.
Take the example above resulting in a ‘Direct Proportion’ level of 72 %. If you send a ‘Modify
Proportion at 5 %’ command, then the level rises from 72 % to approx. 75 % (100 – 44 = 56;
56× 55 % = 30.8; 30.8 + 44 = 74.8).
When sending a negative value, the formula subtracts that value from the ‘Direct Proportion’
level e.g. Still using the same example, if you send ‘Modify Proportion at –5 %’ command, then 
the level decreases from 72% to approx. 69 % (100 – 44 = 56; 56 × 45 % = 25.2;
25.2 + 44 = 69.2).

HelvarNet Errors/Diagnostics
The routers are capable of providing useful diagnostic information for all possible Ethernet I/O
messages received from a 3rd party device . The diagnostic response can provide information
concerning whether a message was successful, was invalid or was not appropriate for a specified
address.
Successful queries will simply be replied with the answer.
However, if the query is invalid or does not contain the correct parameters then an error
diagnostic will be returned, instead of the expected answer, with the original query.
For lighting or configuration commands diagnostic information is available on demand and is
achieved by specifying that you want this information returned using the Ethernet I/O
'Acknowledgment' feature.
In the ASCII format this will mean attaching the parameter ID 'A' with a parameter value of 1 or
in the RAW format by switching the 'Acknowledgment' flag on in the command word.
The following table shows you the raw value and ASCII description for each error message:

Raw Value | ASCII Description
0  |  Success
1  |  Error - Invalid group index parameter
2  |  Error - Invalid cluster parameter
3  |  Error - Invalid router parameter
4  |  Error - Invalid subnet parameter
5  |  Error - Invalid device parameter
6  |  Error - Invalid sub device parameter
7  |  Error - Invalid block parameter
8  |  Error - Invalid scene parameter
9  |  Error - Cluster does not exist
10 |  Error - Router does not exist
11 |  Error - Device does not exist
12 |  Error - Property does not exist
13 |  Error - Invalid RAW message size
14 |  Error - Invalid messages type
15 |  Error - Invalid message command
16 |  Error - Missing ASCII terminator
17 |  Error - Missing ASCII parameter
18 |  Error - Incompatible version

The error message contains the command data which was sent, followed by the data concerning
the erroneous command. See below for an example error message in ASCII and raw formats.
Example ASCII Format

104 - Query Device Type
DALI , Digidim, Imagine (SDIM ) and DMX devices are all capable of returning a device
type. Devices can return more than one piece of type information.
For an ASCII query the response will be four comma separated values, the last of which is
the protocol; the penultimate is the device type; and the remaining two are extra device
information.
For a raw query the response will be returned in a 32 bit Word. The least significant byte
contains the protocol; the next least significant byte contains the main device type; the two
most significant bytes contain extra device information.
The devices protocols are as follows:

Protocol | Values

Discovery Query Commands
The following set of commands are extensions to version 1 and are designed to allow for the
discovery of a Helvar router system.
107 - Query Workgroup Name - UDP Broadcast
By broadcasting this command all Helvar routers that exist on a network, providing that they can
see the message, will respond with the Workgroup name to which they belong. If there are multiple
workgroups, then there will be responses from all routers in all workgroups. 

ASCII Example
If you broadcast (using UDP) the following Query Workgroup Name command:
>V:2,C:107#
All routers will respond with:
?V:2,C:107=WorkgroupName#
For example, a router with workgroup name 'Restaurant' will respond with:
?V:2,C:107=Restaurant#
108 - Query Workgroup Membership
A router will respond to this query with the address strings of the routers that are members of the
workgroup.
An address string contains the IP address of the router, and takes the form of '@10.254.1.1'.
ASCII Example
If you send the following Query Workgroup Membership command:
>V:2,C:108#
A typical response will be:
?V:2,C:108=@10.254.1.1,@10.254.1.2,@10.254.1.3#
165 - Query Groups
A router will respond to this query with the group identifiers of all groups that have been
programmed to the router's workgroup.
The response is a comma delimited string of group identifiers.
ASCII Example
If you send the following Query Groups command:
>V:2,C:165#
A typical response will be:
?V:2,C:165=1,2,3,4,...,100#

164 - Query Group
A router will respond to this query with the address strings of all devices that are members of the
group.
The device address string contains the cluster, router, subnet and device index, and takes the form
of '@1.1.1.34'.
ASCII Example
If you send the following Query Groups command:
>V:2,C:164,G:100#
A typical response will be:
?V:2,C:164,G:100=@1.1.1.34,@1.1.1.35,@1.1.1.36#
166 - Query Scene Names
A router will respond to this query with the scene descriptions that are prefixed with the
corresponding group, block and scene.
The scene description string contains the group, block, and scene numbers and scene description,
and takes the form of '@G.B.S:Description'.
ASCII Example
If you send the following Query Groups command:
>V:2,C:166#
A typical response will be:
?V:2,C:166=@1.1.1:Morning@1.1.2:Afternoon@1.1.3:Night#
167 - Query Scene Info
When targeted at a load interface, the response will include all of the scene levels.
The response will contain all 136 scene levels, in a comma delimited format.
Ignores are represented by '*'. Last Level is represented by 'L'.
ASCII Example
If you send the following Query Groups command:
>V:2,C:167@1.1.1.4#
A typical response will be:
?V:2,C:167@1.1.1.4=100,75,50,25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,L,L,L,0,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,(3
3-128),*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*#

Note: (33-128) in the above example represents scenes 33 to 128.

Measurement / Input / Level Query Commands
Note: Devices / subdevices of this type must be configured in Designer before you can query
their measurement, input(s) or level. Specifically, they must be grouped
150 - Query Measurement
For analogue types, e.g. light measurement (Multisensor), analogue input (Analogue Input
Unit).
Note: If sent to a digital device / subdevice which does not perform any measurement, for
example a Button Panel, then you will receive a 'Property does not exist' error message. See
Error / Diagnostic Messages..
Command
Send: Command (150), Cluster (1..253), Router (1..254), Subnet (1..4), Device (1..255),
Subdevice (1..16)
Reply
Returns the measurement from the device / subdevice:
Command (150), Cluster (1..253), Router (1..254), Subnet (1..4), Device (1..255),
Subdevice (1..16), Measurement (1..100)
ASCII Example
If you send the following Query Measurement command (including the full address of the
subdevice):
>V:1,C:150,@2.2.1.1.4#
If the measurement from the subdevice is 100, then the reply will be:
?V:1,C:150,@2.2.1.1.4=100#

151 - Query Inputs
Returns the state or digital input(s) of: a device (e.g. for the PIR detector of a Multisensor -
0x01=occupied within past minute, 0x00=unoccupied); or the LEDs of a button panel; or
the switch inputs of an input unit. If sent to the device level, summarises the digital input
state. If sent to the subdevice level, gives the state of that subdevice’s input.
Note: Before running Query Inputs, make sure that the input source has been set via Designer
for input devices such as the 444 Mini Input Unit or 942 Analogue Input Unit . See Analogue
Mode Configuration and Edge Mode Configuration.
Command
Send: Command (151), Cluster (1..253), Router (1..254), Subnet (1..4), Device (1..255),
Subdevice (1..16)
Reply
Returns the input state of the device / subdevice:
Command (151), Cluster (1..253), Router (1..254), Subnet (1..4), Device (1..255),
Subdevice (1..16), Input State (see below)
The majority of subdevices have on and off states and are therefore represented by 0 (OFF)
or 1 (ON). For example, buttons with LEDs will either be pressed (LED on) or not pressed
(LED off). See below for the exceptions.
Mini Input Unit: As there are 8 inputs on this device there will be 8 states e.g.
01001100 would be represented in ASCII as 50.
Slider: 0..100 (level in %)
Analogue Input Unit: 0..100 (level in %)
ASCII Example
If you send the following Query Inputs command to a subdevice (including the full address
of the subdevice):
>V:1,C:151,@2.2.1.1.4#
If the state of the subdevice is ON, then the reply will be:
?V:1,C:151,@2.2.1.1.4=1#

152 - Query Load Level
Note: This command should not be sent to any device other than a load (control gear),
otherwise you will receive a 'Property does not exist' error message. See Error / Diagnostic
Messages.
Command
Send: Command (152), Cluster (1..253), Router (1..254), Subnet (1..4), Device (1..255)
Reply
Command (152), Cluster (1..253), Router (1..254), Subnet (1..4), Device (1..255), Load
Level (1..100)
ASCII Example
If you send the following Query Load Level command (including the full address of the
device):
>V:1,C:152,@1.1.2.15#
If the load level is 25%, then the reply will be:
?V:1,C:152,@1.1.2.15=25#
Note:Query load level commands may also report a level even though the device may be set
to 'Off'. This is because the load level is set below the switch on level.
 Levels above 50% may be subject to a 1% swing when returning levels due to the
DALI standard logarithmic dimming curve . E.g. setting the level of a DALI ballast to
93% in Designer will cause the router to actually return a level of 92% when queried
using Ethernet I/O. This is because 93% is not accounted for in the DALI logarithmic
dimming curve. The router always assigns the closest dimming curve level to the level
set in Designer. For further information see DALI Logarithmic Dimming Levels
ASCII Example
If you send the following Query Load Level command (including the full address of the
device):
>V:1,C:152,@1.1.2.15#
If the load level is set at 1% and the switch on level is 2%, then the reply will be:
?V:1,C:152,@1.1.2.15=2147483649#
The ASCII and Raw reply responses, 2147483649 and 0x80000001 are synonymous. If these replies are
returned following a query load level request then the device at the specified address is 'Off' even though it
appears 'On'.
